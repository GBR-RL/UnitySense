# 🤖 UnitySense — Real-Time Sensor-Driven Unity Control

A real-time robotic control system powered by physical sensors integrated into a 3D Unity environment. This project uses ESP8266 to send data over Wi-Fi via UDP, controlling a robot, opening doors, and displaying sensor outputs live in-game.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project bridges physical sensor data and Unity's virtual environment using Wi-Fi-based communication. A robot character in a Unity scene interacts with doors, temperature UI, and movement controls—all triggered by real sensor inputs.

## 📽️ Working Demo

Here’s a glimpse of the real-time interaction between physical sensors and the Unity environment.  
The ESP8266 sends live sensor data over Wi-Fi, which is then used to control the robot, trigger doors, and update the temperature display.

> ✅ The robot moves using gyroscope & encoder inputs  
> ✅ Doors toggle via proximity sensor  
> ✅ Temperature values are streamed in real-time and shown in Unity UI

## 🔧 Hardware & Software Stack

### Hardware

- **ESP8266**: Microcontroller with Wi-Fi module
- **MPU6050**: Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Temperature sensor
- **Rotary Encoder**
- **Proximity (IR) Sensor**

### Software

- **Unity 2022.3 or later**
- **Arduino IDE** for ESP8266 programming
- **C# scripting** for Unity event handling (VScode)
- **UDP Protocol** for fast real-time transmission

---

## 💡 Core Features

- ✅ Live robot control in Unity using real-time gyroscope + encoder data
- ✅ Doors open based on proximity sensor triggers
- ✅ Temperature sensor displayed in real-time using Unity UI
- ✅ Movement and camera orientation mapped to sensor axes
- ✅ UDP communication pipeline from ESP8266 → Unity

## 🧠 Communication Protocol (UDP)

### ESP8266 Output Format

- Sends sensor values as comma-separated strings:

```
gx, gy, gz, temp, proximity, encoderPosition, encoderSwitch
```

- Example: `-12.3,45.8,-3.9,26.7,1,8,0`

### Unity UDP Receiver

- Listens on port `12345`
- Script `UDPReceiver.cs` parses incoming packets
- Updates variables in scripts for:
  - Movement
  - Camera
  - Door toggling
  - Temperature UI

## 🎮 Game Mechanics Mapping

| Sensor             | Unity Action                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Gyroscope (gy)     | Forward/Backward/Sprint movement     |
| Gyroscope (gx/gz)  | Yaw/Pitch camera control             |
| Encoder Position   | Left/Right strafe                    |
| Encoder Switch     | Jump                                 |
| Proximity Sensor   | Door toggle based on player position |
| Temperature Sensor | UI temperature display using TMPro   |

## 🛠️ Unity Scene

The Unity scene includes:

- A robot character controlled by sensor input
- A house with multiple rooms and three sensor-activated doors
- `Playground 1.unity` is the main scene file

### Key Unity Scripts:

- `UDPReceiver.cs`
- `Door1.cs`, `Door2.cs`, `Door3.cs`
- `TemperatureDisplay.cs`
- `ThirdPersonController.cs`

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

#### Unity Setup

1. **Install Unity (2022.3 or later)**  
   Download from: [https://unity.com/releases](https://unity.com/releases)

2. **Open the Project via Unity Hub**  
   Select the UnitySense project folder.

3. **Load Scene**  
   Open `Playground 1.unity` inside the Unity editor.

4. **Check GameObjects**
   - **Robot**: Should have movement + camera control via sensor data.
   - **Doors**: Scripts (`Door1.cs`, etc.) should be attached and respond to proximity inputs.
   - **UDPReceiver**: Must be configured to port `12345`.

5. **Prepare the Microcontroller**
   - Upload the `esp8266_sensor_udp.ino` file to the **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** using the Arduino IDE.
   - Ensure the correct **board type** and **COM port** are selected.
   - Verify all sensors are properly connected and powered.

6. **Firewall Settings**  
   Make sure your **firewall allows UDP traffic** on port `12345`. This is necessary for Unity to receive data from the ESP8266.

7. **Run the Unity Scene**  
   Press the ▶️ **Play** button in Unity. The robot should begin responding to sensor inputs once the NodeMCU is powered and running.
